University of Buenos Aires – Institute of Calculus

Objective: Evaluate the prognostic impact of Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) at day 15 in pediatric ALL patients.

Cohort: Prospective multicenter study in Argentina (n = 2,096), treated under the GATLA protocol.

Analyses:

Descriptive statistics

Kaplan–Meier survival curves & log-rank tests

Univariate and multivariable Cox proportional hazards models

Model diagnostics & assumption checks

Key findings:

Intermediate and high MRD levels independently associated with lower overall survival

MRD confirmed as the most relevant prognostic factor

Tools: Analyses performed in R (v4.1.3) following reproducible research practices
