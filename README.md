Capstone Project – Statistics for Health Sciences

University of Buenos Aires – Institute of Calculus

This repository contains a Capstone Project analyzing overall survival in pediatric patients with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) in Argentina.

Objective:

Evaluate the prognostic impact of Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) at day 15 in pediatric ALL patients.

Cohort:

Prospective multicenter study in Argentina (n = 2,096)

Patients treated under the GATLA protocol

Analyses:

Descriptive statistics

Kaplan–Meier survival curves & log-rank tests

Univariate and multivariable Cox proportional hazards models

Model diagnostics & assumption checks

Key findings:

Intermediate and high MRD levels were independently associated with lower overall survival

MRD confirmed as the most relevant prognostic factor

Tools:

All analyses performed in R (v4.1.3) following reproducible research practices
