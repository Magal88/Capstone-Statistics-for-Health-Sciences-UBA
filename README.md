Capstone Project – Statistics for Health Sciences
University of Buenos Aires – Institute of Calculus

This project analyzes overall survival in pediatric patients with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) in Argentina, using a prospective multicenter cohort (n = 2,096) treated under the GATLA protocol.

The main objective was to assess the prognostic impact of Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) at day 15 of treatment.

Statistical analyses included:

Descriptive statistics

Kaplan–Meier survival curves and log-rank tests

Univariate and multivariable Cox proportional hazards models

Model diagnostics and assumption checks

Results showed that intermediate and high MRD levels were independently associated with reduced overall survival, confirming MRD as the most relevant prognostic factor.

All analyses were performed in R (v4.1.3) following reproducible research practices.
